# SpotifyWeb
This plugin connects to your [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) account and polls for the current track. It then displays the `track title` in the `status bar` of [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). The song is only displayed if Spotify is not paused/stopped.

It is possible to Enable/Disable the plugin and also change the polling interval.

## Fork note
I updated the code so that users can see the artist name if there is one artist performing in the song, if more than one Various Artists will be displayed near the song name.  

## Installation
Search for `SpotifyWeb` on [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st3) or clone this repository into `Preferences` :arrow_right:  `Browse Packages`.

Note, that the plugin depends on [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io), which in turn depends on [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests). The former is included in this repository, while the later is fetched by [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st3). So even if you download this repository manually you still need to have [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st3) installed to fetch the dependency on [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests).

## Requirements
This plugin has only been tested with Sublime Text 3.

## Why do I have to register my own app?
Extracted from [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications):
```
Always store keys securely! Regenerate your client secret if you suspect it has been compromised!
```
This means that unfortunately every user has to register his/her own app.
